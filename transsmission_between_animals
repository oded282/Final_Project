1|('camel', 'bat')|however , there has been no other reported virus spillover from bats to camels beside this ancestral mers-cov and 229e-related coronaviruses .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6818114/pdf/
2|('human', 'pig')|although unlikely , the possibility that sars-cov positive animals were infected from humans can not be formally excluded , and it was indeed reported that sars-cov was transmitted from man to pig [ 7 ] .
|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2005.07.075
3|('human', 'bat')|although an origin of sars-related cov in bats is confi rmed ( 9 , 36 ) , sars-cov precursors have existed in carnivores some time before the sars epidemic and have been transmitted from carnivores to humans again at least one additional time after the end of the epidemic ( 37 , 38 ) .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3165994/pdf/
4|('human', 'bird')|fortunately , it is not easily transmitted from birds to humans , and more importantly , human to human spread is poor .

5|('camel', 'human')|sequence analysis of the virus isolated from the case and the camel was identical , clearly indicating that mers-cov can indeed be transmitted from camels to human ( azhar et al. , 2014 ) .

6|('swine', 'human')|recent studies reveal influenza a virus can be transmitted from human to a range of animal species ( especially swine ) , a phenomenon known as reverse zoonosis [ 6 ] .

7|('camel', 'human')|( ii ) mers-cov could be transmitted from humans to camels , which means that humans serve as a source of mers-cov for camels .

8|('camel', 'human')|since its first outbreak in 2012 , the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases , causing 851 deaths .

9|('qatar', 'human')|1 in september 2012 , similar virus was recovered from a patient with severe respiratory symptoms who had a history of travel to saudi arabia and had been transferred from a hospital in qatar to a hospital in london and so named as human coronavirus england 1 .

10|('human', 'bird')|another emerging pathogen of concern is the avian influenza h5n1 virus , highly pathogenic among birds , that in some cases has been transmitted from birds to humans .

11|('human', 'bird')|recently , cases of influenza a virus h7n9 transmitted from birds to humans have been reported [ 2 ] .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4124145/pdf/
12|('swine', 'human')|on the other hand , the novel swine influenza a ( h1n1 ) virus is also typically a zoonotic infection , transmitted from swine hosts to humans ; however , the ensuing direct human to human transmission was the signifying characteristic of the pathogen and the major factor leading to the 2009 pandemic .
|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2010.03444.x
13|('canine', 'bovine')|it has been suggested that crcov might share the same ancestor in this clade , or originated from a host transfer from bovine to canine ( erles et al. , 2003 ) .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7089282/pdf/
14|('human', 'bat')|however , with rare direct contacts between such bats and humans , similar to sars-cov and mers-cov , it seems to be more likely that the spillover of 2019-ncov to humans from another intermediate host rather than directly from bats .
|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.954628
15|('human', 'bat')|notably , it appears as if coronaviruses are able to cause serious viral infections when transferred from their reservoir ( wild bat ) host to the human host as observed previously for ebola virus as well which was transmitted from wild bats to humans in africa .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5640221/pdf/
16|('camel', 'bat')|the origin of the virus is believed to be bats , from which it was then transferred to camels .

17|('civet', 'human')|it is believed that a novel coronavirus , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , was passed from palm civets to humans and caused the epidemic of sars in 2002 to 2003 .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2446986/pdf/
18|('human', 'dog')|human influenza viruses such as h1n1 can cause disease in dogs and may have the potential to spread from infected dogs back to humans .

19|('camel', 'human')|85 , 86 later , rising mers-cov antibodies were documented in the patient , suggesting that mers-cov infection was transmitted from the camels to the human and not vice versa .

20|('civet', 'human')|thus civet viral strains with ser487 can transmit from civets to civets , but not from humans to humans .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3840050/pdf/
21|('civet', 'human')|the first k479n mutation allowed sars-cov to jump from civets to humans and the second s487 t mutation allowed sars-cov to transmit from human to human , leading to the severe sars outbreak in 2002 - 2003 .

22|('camel', 'human')|the figure shows the path by which the virus is transmitted from the infected camel to the human and camel to various animals ( kandeil et al. , 2019 ) ; further , this virus is transmitted to other human population via human to human transmissions ( shehata et al. , 2016 ) .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6448012/pdf/
23|('human', 'bat')|both mers-cov and sars-cov are zoonotic pathogens and are believed to have been transmitted from a natural host , possibly bats , to humans through intermediate mammalian hosts 12 , 13 .

25|('human', 'bird')|transmission of avian flu h5n1to humans usually involves direct contact with infected birds , but if the virus mutates and becomes more easily spread from human to human ( e.g. , airborne by the respiratory route ) , this could start an influenza pandemic or worldwide outbreak of disease .

28|('civet', 'human')|the global outbreak that occurred in 2002/03 and the cluster of 2003/04 sars cases were the result of two independent zoonotic transfers from palm civets to humans [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] .

30|('cat', 'feline')|feline leukemia virus ( felv ) , feline immunodeficiency virus ( fiv ) and feline coronavirus ( fcov ) are organisms that spread directly from cat to cat ; feral cats could serve as a source of infection to pet cats allowed outdoors or other freeroaming cats .

31|('civet', 'human')|we provide the first direct evidence that sars-cov was transmitted from palm civets to humans , and that a restaurant serving palm civets positive for this virus was the source of infection for 2 of 4 confirmed sars patients during the resurgence of sars in the winter of 2003 - 2004 ( 6,17 ) .

0|(human,bat,dromedary,camel,civet,cui)|sars-cov and mers-cov are considered highly pathogenic ( cui et al. , 2019 ) , and it is very likely that both sars-cov and mers-cov were transmitted from bats to palm civets ( guan et al. , 2003 ) or dromedary camels ( drosten et al. , 2014 ) , and finally to humans ( cui et al. , 2019 ) .

1|(mosquito,human,tick)|the majority ( 60.3 % ) of these emerging infectious diseases ( eid ) originated from ( wild ) animal reservoirs , and approximately one in five was transmitted from animal reservoir hosts to humans by disease vectors ( ticks , mosquitos , midges ) [ 1 ] .

10|(dromedary,camel,human)|covs are generally considered to be host-specific ; however , cross-species transmission does occur which may lead to incidental infections like the spillover of mers-cov from dromedary camel to humans , where humans function as an incidental and ultimately dead-end host [ 4 ] .
|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6723642/pdf/
11|(mosquito,human,tick,bat,bird,sandfly,fox,rodent)|we have divided the virus infections into two categories , those that are transmitted to humans directly from vertebrate animals ( like rodents , foxes , bats and birds ) and those that are primarily transmitted by arthropods ( mosquitoes , ticks , sandflies ) .

12|(civet,cat,bat,human)|the emergence of the sars coronavirus around 2002 probably involved the transfer of the virus from a bat to a carnivore ( probably a civet cat ) ; contact with civets may have facilitated the human outbreak .

20|(swine,sparrow,bird)|these avian covs were monophyletically related to covs from sparrow ( spacov hku19 ) and swine ( porcov hku15 ) , which were also found to be δ-cov. this information supports the hypothesis that δ-cov can cross inter-species barriers , with the potential to transmit from birds to swine [ 8 ] .

23|(civet,human,bat)|perhaps the most well-known example of viral cross-species transmission involves the sars-cov. studies support a transmission model in which a sars-like cov was transmitted from rhinolophus bats to palm civets , which subsequently transmitted the palm civet-adapted virus to humans at local food markets in southern china .
