12|('swine', 'human')|on the other hand , the novel swine influenza a ( h1n1 ) virus is also typically a zoonotic infection , transmitted from swine hosts to humans ; however , the ensuing direct human to human transmission was the signifying characteristic of the pathogen and the major factor leading to the 2009 pandemic .

14|('human', 'bat')|however , with rare direct contacts between such bats and humans , similar to sars-cov and mers-cov , it seems to be more likely that the spillover of 2019-ncov to humans from another intermediate host rather than directly from bats .

25|('bird','human')|transmission of avian flu h5n1to humans usually involves direct contact with infected birds , but if the virus mutates and becomes more easily spread from human to human ( e.g. , airborne by the respiratory route ) , this could start an influenza pandemic or worldwide outbreak of disease .
